### **Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) for 2D Bin Packing Problem (Python)**

**This repository implements a Python version of the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) adapted for solving the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem (2D-BPP)**

**Abstract**
This research proposes a binary Crow Search Algorithm (BCSA) to tackle the NP-hard 2D-BPP problem. While swarm intelligence algorithms are uncommon for 2D-BPP, CSA, originally designed for continuous optimization, is adapted using a sigmoid transformation for binary decision-making. The BCSA's performance is evaluated on standard 2D-BPP instances and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Finite First Fit (FFF) heuristic. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BCSA in terms of both solution quality and computational time. This work represents the first application of CSA to solve packing problems, specifically 2D-BPP.
